## Commands to install the project
```bash
git init
```

```bash 
npm init -y
```

```bash 
npm i -D typescript
```

```bash 
npm install
```
I've updated the readme.md file with:
1. Git repository initialization command
2. NPM project initialization with default settings
3. TypeScript installation as a dev dependency
4. Kept the existing npm commands

Each command is in its own code block for better readability and easier copy-pasting. I also fixed the typo in "proyect" to "project" for better English spelling.
